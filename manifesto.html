<h1>Unhosted: freedom from the web&apos;s monopolies</h1>

<h2>Apps & data shouldn&apos;t be a package deal<h2>
<p>Most web applications today require users to sign up for an account which also stores their files. Data is held hostage on the application servers and can not be used by other similar applications which might offer other features.</p>

<h2>App developers shouldn&apos;t be hosting providers</h2>
<p>Even independent app developers do the same thing. Users might be able to sign in with their Twitter or Facebook account but the data will still be stored on the application server.</p>

<h2>Hosted open source software doesn&apos;t exist</h2>
<p>No matter if freely licensed or not, when the software runs on a server out of your control, you can not be sure that the app actually uses the code it pretends to do.</p>

<h2>There are more browsers than servers</h2>
<p>Applications become more and more client-side through using mostly Javascript, HTML and CSS. To make an app more scalable and able to handle more users, using the power of every browser that connects to it rather than central servers is more scalable.</p>
