Hi, 

With summer starting, it's time to code for cotton! :) Actually, that 
phrase is from Google Summer of Code, but if you know a bit of php and 
want to get into contributing to a free software project like ours, i 
wil personally fabricate a cool exclusive Unhosted Contributor T-shirt 
for you. So, let me know! :) We need a php client so that OpenPhoto, 
WordPress, and StatusNet can all run in tandem with a remoteStorage 
server. We thought about doing it the other way around, but i think 
this is a more scalable approach. 

So the way it would work is you take a VPS and install ownCloud, 
StatusNet, OpenPhoto and WordPress on it. You use the ownCloud 
instance as the remoteStorage server. Then in StatusNet, OpenPhoto and 
WordPress, you activate "use custom storage backend", so that 
everything you do on your blog (WordPress), your photoblog 
(OpenPhoto), and your microblog (StatusNet) is stored on your 
remoteStorage (ownCloud). 

This "use custom storage backend" option is what I already started 
coding into OpenPhoto, and it sort of works, but i have no time to 
continue it right now. So we need your help. :) 

Even if you only want to see what you can get done in one Saturday, or 
you're not sure if you're very good at php, chances are you're 
probably better at it than me, so just contact me and we'll get you 
set up. Looking forward to overwhelming replies from all php coders 
out there. :) 


Cheers!
